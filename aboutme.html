                journal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path,
                    I've made the big jump over to the bootcamp to get expert code reviews 
                    of my solo projects and meet like minded peers
                </p>
                <h3>How i stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>I like to thik of myself as a life long learner. 
                        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try 
                        to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                        work new techniques into existing projects
                </p>
                <p>While that was fun, I felt it would be helpful to share 
                        what I was learning and most things about my journey 
                        with the world
                </p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal 
                        site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After 
                        each learning lesson, I'd use my notes to not only reflect 
                        on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I 
                        learned using my own notes.
                </p>
                <p>That helped me grow whilst I was learning, and I realised 
                        that posting my learning summaries was also helping others 
                        learn and stay motivated.
                </p>
